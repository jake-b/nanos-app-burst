Waves wallet application for Ledger Nano S

# Introduction

This is a proof-of concept Ledger Nano S wallet app for Waves platform.

## Original description of Burst wallet

I say that it is proof of concept for a few reasons:

- I am not a cryptography or crypto-currency expert, and I could have introduced
  errors or security flaws into the code unintentionally. 

- I am knowingly using an ED25519 seed function to generate a Curve25519 keypair
  I think this is okay, and I'll discuss it more below, but I'm not sure. See
  "technical details" section below.

- Just in general, you shouldn't trust others with your crypto-currency.

Do not use this on your production Ledger Wallet.  I'm not responsible if you
lose your BURST or your other crypto-currencies on the same Ledger device. 

**I recommend using this only on a Ledger Nano explicitly earmarked for
'development' and one that does not contain keys for any crypto-currentcy you
care about.  Furthermore, I recommend it only for use on the Burstcoin
testnet**

# License

Copyright (c) 2017-2018 Jake B. Updated by Waves community.

This application is based on example sources from Ledger that were released under
the Apache License, Version 2.0 and I have maintained this license for this app.

Other public domain materials, such as the Curve25519 sources, or implementations 
of known algorithms are also included.

# Building

You'll need a Ledger Nano S development environment.  More information can be 
found here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-devenv/

A modification to the current version of the python loader app may be required
depending on whether Ledger has released a new version or not.  More on this here:

# Technical Details

## Why I used a curve25519 library rather than internal functions

I spent some time trying to get the Ledger-provided keypair generation and curve
multiplication functions to do the necessary cryptographic singing necessary
for Burstcoin.

After some time, I gave up and just went with a library known to work.  I'm not
sure why the internal functions didn't work properly.  I tried all sorts of
combinations and endianess but never got a keypair that worked.  Possibilities
include:

- I was just doing something wrong, misunderstanding the SDK or the cryptography
- Keys and signatures may have been in a different format than Burst expects...
Possibly endianness or key format, I'm not an expert.
- Possibly Curve25519 is not fully implemented in the Ledger SDK
- Possible Burst uses a specific variant or dialect of Curve25519, and I'm not
aware.

## Why do I use the ED25519 key data generation function instead of Curve25519?

The Ledger smartly uses a system of entitlements for apps.  At load time, you 
need to declare which BIP39 keypaths and algorithms your app exepects to
generate.

This prevents a malicious or poorly secured app from generating keys or signing
transactions for a crypto-coin outside of the declared BIP39 keypath or for an
algorithm that is not explicitly needed by the Ledger app.

The function involved is called os_perso_derive_node_bip32:

     os_perso_derive_node_bip32(CX_CURVE_Ed25519, path, 5, privateKeyData, NULL);

I use CX_CURVE_Ed25519 because the entitlement system doesn't apparently
support the CX_CURVE_Curve25519 flag.

I think both ED25519 and Curve25591 expect the key data 'secret' to be a
265-byte integer... so I think this is okay... but I'm not an expert as to
whether this introduces security or cryptography problems.  Hence, I recommend
this for use on the testnet only at this time.

## Web Integration

Modifications to the PoCC Web Wallet for interfacing with the Ledger Nano S
can be found here: https://github.com/jake-b/burstcoin/tree/ledger

Note you need to enable "Web Browser" support in the app on the Ledger device
in order to switch from the standard communication protocol to the U2F 
protocol.

# Room for improvement

Lots of room to grow here.  I make no promises to move this forward.  I would
like to move my Ledger Nano from "Development" to "Production use" and that 
would halt my ability to develop.  I may get another unit for development 
eventually.

Some ideas for improvement:

- Peer review to make sure this is cryptographically sound and secure.
- Progress indicators on the device -- "Please Wait" screens etc, so the
user knows something is going on.
- Support for other types of transactions on the "Confirm Transaction" screen
currently it is very "Send Money" focused.
- A web developer should really look at the desktop/web stuff to fix and
improve the experience.
- Support for multiple wallets (derived wallets/addresses)
